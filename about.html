            <h2>Our Heritage</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010 by the Rossi family, Napoli Artesanal brings three generations of Neapolitan pizza-making tradition to authentic food lovers. Our story began in the heart of Naples, where Nonna Maria perfected her craft using techniques passed down through our family.</p>
            <p>What started as a small neighborhood pizzeria has grown into a destination for those seeking the true taste of Naples. We remain family-owned and operated, with every pizza still made according to Nonna Maria's original recipes and strict quality standards.</p>

            <h2>Our Pizza Philosophy</h2>
            <p>At Napoli Artesanal, we believe pizza is not just food—it's an experience. Our mission is to serve the most authentic Neapolitan pizza using time-honored techniques that respect tradition while embracing quality.</p>
            <p><strong>Our core principles:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Authenticity First:</strong> Every pizza follows strict VPN (True Neapolitan Pizza) standards</li>
                <li><strong>Ingredient Excellence:</strong> We import key ingredients weekly from Campania, Italy</li>
                <li><strong>Craft Over Convenience:</strong> 48-hour dough fermentation for optimal flavor and digestibility</li>
                <li><strong>Community Connection:</strong> We're not just a restaurant—we're your neighborhood pizzeria</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Why We're Different</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <h3>Certified Neapolitan Craftsmanship</h3>
                    <p>We are one of the few pizzerias outside Italy certified by the Associazione Verace Pizza Napoletana. This means every pizza meets strict standards for ingredients, preparation, and cooking methods.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Direct Italian Imports</h3>
                    <p>We source our "00" flour, San Marzano DOP tomatoes, and extra virgin olive oil directly from small producers in Campania. No compromises, no substitutions—just authentic Italian quality.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Wood-Fired Perfection</h3>
                    <p>Our custom-built Stefano Ferrara ovens reach 900°F, cooking each pizza in exactly 90 seconds. This creates the characteristic leopard-spot crust and smoky flavor that defines true Neapolitan pizza.</p>
