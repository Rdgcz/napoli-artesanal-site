            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2010 by the Rossi family, Napoli Artesanal brings the authentic taste of Naples
                 to pizza lovers around the world. Our journey began in a small kitchen in the heart of 
                 Naples, where Nonna Maria perfected her pizza recipe using techniques passed down through generations.</p>
            <p>What started as a family passion project has grown into a beloved restaurant known for its
                 commitment to traditional methods and exceptional quality. We continue to honor our Neapolitan
                  roots while embracing innovation in our craft.</p>
